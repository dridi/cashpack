DESCRIPTION
===========

This is an overview of dynamic table probing with cashpack, a stateless
event-driven HPACK codec written in C. Both HPACK decoders and encoders share
a dynamic table in sync, it is possible outside of block processing to probe
the contents of the dynamic table. However, the dynamic table entries are not
persistent and MUST be considered stale after the decoding or encoding of an
HPACK block if ``EVICT`` or ``INDEX`` events occurred.

The ``hpack_static()`` and ``hpack_dynamic()`` functions walk respectively the
static table and the dynamic table of *hpack* and calls *cb* for all entries
events, passing a *priv* pointer that can be used to maintain state. The
``hpack_static()`` function ALWAYS emits the same sequence of events. The
``hpack_tables()`` function probes both the static and dynamic table for its
*hpack* argument.

The ``hpack_entry()`` function extracts an entry from both tables based on a
global index *idx*. When the function returns, *nam* and *val* respectively
point to the name and value of the indexed field.

The ``hpack_search()`` function searches for a best match for *nam* and *val*
in both the static and dynamic tables of *hpack*. It sets *idx* to the field's
index or zero if none was found. If a full match is not found, it may match
a field's name instead and therefore *val* is allowed to be ``NULL``.

The ``HPACK_STATIC`` and ``HPACK_OVERHEAD`` macros represent respectively the
number of entries in the static table and the per-entry overhead in dynamic
tables, as per the RFC.

FOREACH STATE MACHINE
=====================

The state machine is very straightforward. For each field, exactly three
events are emitted in this order: ``FIELD``, ``NAME`` and ``VALUE``.

::

    (start)
       |
       +---> FIELD ---> NAME
       |       ^          |
       v       |          v
     (end) <---+------- VALUE

The ``NAME`` and ``VALUE`` events provide null-terminated character strings
pointing directly inside the dynamic table. Dereferencing stale pointers is
undefined behavior. See ``cashpack``\ (3) for more details on the events
semantics. Static entries are always safe to dereference.

RETURN VALUE
============

The ``hpack_static()``, ``hpack_dynamic()``, ``hpack_tables()`` and
``hpack_entry()`` functions return ``HPACK_RES_OK``.  On error, these
functions returns one of the listed errors.

The ``hpack_search()`` function returns ``HPACK_RES_OK`` for a full match
and ``HPACK_RES_NAM`` if only a field name matched.

ERRORS
======

The ``hpack_static()`` function can fail with the following errors:

``HPACK_RES_ARG``: *cb* is ``NULL``.

The ``hpack_dynamic()`` and ``hpack_tables()`` functions can fail with the
following errors:

``HPACK_RES_ARG``: *hpack* doesn't point to a valid codec or *cb* is ``NULL``.

The ``hpack_entry()`` function can fail with the following errors:

``HPACK_RES_ARG``: *hpack*, *nam* or *val* is ``NULL``.

``HPACK_RES_IDX``: *idx* is not a valid index.

The ``hpack_search()`` function can fail with the following errors:

``HPACK_RES_ARG``: *hpack* doesn't point to a valid codec or *nam* is
``NULL``.

``HPACK_RES_IDX``: *idx* no match found in the tables.
